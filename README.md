## 👋 Hi, I’m Shrish

I’m an aspiring **Cyber Security Apprentice** based in London.

I come from a **Business and Management** background and transitioned into tech through
**self-study and hands-on projects**, focusing on understanding how systems work rather
than just learning syntax.

- **HTML & CSS** (personal portfolio website)
- **Cyber Security fundamentals** (port scanning, password hashing, ethical awareness)

### 📌 Featured Projects
- 🌦 **Weather App (Python + API + GUI)**  
  Desktop application that fetches live weather data, handles API errors, and displays
  results through a graphical user interface.

- 🔐 **Python + SQL Password System**  
  Backend-focused project demonstrating secure password hashing and database storage
  using Python and SQLite.

- 🔍 **Port Scanner (Python)**  
  A security-focused project that scans open ports on a target system to understand
  network exposure, built with an emphasis on ethical and responsible use.

- 🌐 **HTML/CSS Portfolio Website**  
  A personal website showcasing my projects, skills, and learning journey.
